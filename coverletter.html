    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,<br>
        I am writing to express my interest in the 2026 Software Engineer Summer Internship Program
        at JPMorgan Chase. As a full-time Computer Science student at Western Governors University
        with a background in healthcare, I bring a unique blend of problem-solving, resilience, and
        people-focused experience to the field of technology. I’m excited by the opportunity to grow
        within an innovative, global team that values impact, collaboration, and continuous learning.
        I currently work as a Registered Nurse in a fast-paced clinical environment, where I continue to
        strengthen skills in critical thinking, adaptability, and effective communication. These are core
        traits I carry with me as I transition into software engineering. Over time, I realized that although
        I found fulfillment in helping others, I was increasingly drawn to fields that challenge me
        intellectually in new and evolving ways. Programming reawakened my curiosity. It constantly
        asks, “How can we solve this?” and “Can we make it better?” These are the kinds of questions
        that fuel my drive to learn and build.
        I am currently building foundational skills in Python, developing small console applications that
        simulate real-world logic such as classification tools, logic games, and user-driven input systems.
        These projects have helped me reinforce core programming concepts and apply them in practical
        ways. As I grow my experience in web development, data structures, and Git workflows, I am
        eager to bring that same curiosity and work ethic into a team-oriented engineering environment.
        As a longtime JPMorgan Chase client, I’ve experienced firsthand the reliability, security, and
        innovation that define your digital services. I’m excited by the opportunity to contribute to a
        company that not only sets the standard in finance and technology but also emphasizes
        mentorship, inclusion, and community impact.
        Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to learn, contribute,
        and grow with your team. I am enthusiastic about the challenges this program offers and
        confident in my ability to bring value as a quick learner and collaborative teammate.<br>
        Sincerely, <br>
        Theresa Ta
