    <h2 class="noborder">Dear Hiring Manager,</h2>
    <main>
        I am writing to express my interest in the <strong>Software Engineer Summer Internship Program</strong>. 
        As a full-time Computer Science student at <em>Western Governors University</em> with a background in 
        healthcare, I bring a unique blend of problem-solving, resilience, and people-focused experience 
        to the field of technology. I'm excited by the opportunity to grow within an innovative, global 
        team that values impact, collaboration, and continuous learning.<br>

        I currently work as a Registered Nurse in a fast-paced clinical environment, where I continue to
        strengthen skills in critical thinking, adaptability, and effective communication. These are core
        traits I carry with me as I transition into software engineering. Over time, I realized that although
        I found fulfillment in helping others, I was increasingly drawn to fields that challenge me
        intellectually in new and evolving ways. Programming reawakened my curiosity and I find myself constantly
        asking, ‚ÄúHow can we solve this?‚Äù and ‚ÄúCan we make it better?‚Äù These are the kinds of questions
        that fuel my drive to learn and build.

        I am currently building foundational skills in Python, developing small console applications that
        simulate real-world logic such as classification tools, logic games, and user-driven input systems.
        These projects have helped me reinforce core programming concepts and apply them in practical
        ways. As I grow my experience in web development, data structures, and Git workflows, I am
        eager to bring that same curiosity and work ethic into a team-oriented engineering environment.
        As a longtime JPMorgan Chase client, I've experienced firsthand the reliability, security, and
        innovation that define your digital services. I'm excited by the opportunity to contribute to a
        company that not only sets the standard in finance and technology but also emphasizes
        mentorship, inclusion, and community impact.
